# quiz_app

Hi, This is an app i created to learn about Firebase and Flutter. It is a simple Quiz app where user can login or sign up using an email and a password. After that user will be landed on to a quiz list page where he can see available quizes and on tapping "View Quiz" they will be taken to a page where they can view their past attempts(if any) and also see how others have performed in that particular quiz, Leaderboard.

Here are a few screenshots of the app -
